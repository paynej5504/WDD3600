This code is currently the beginning stages of a website that is created using the tutorial from "Node.js - The Complete Guide" by Maximilian Schwarzmuller.
This website is still in progress and is not yet complete.

## Before download
This website uses Node.js, Express, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and sequelize. Before you download the files make sure you have Node.js and Express downloaded.
You can get the latest version of Node.js here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ .
 You can install Express by opening GitBash ( which you can download here https://git-scm.com/ ) and type ```npm install express``` then press enter.
 This website also uses the templating language ejs. Make sure you install that before running.
 You will also need to connect the code to a database. In this code I use MongoDB, however, feel free to use the database of your choice. Code for the database can be found in "util/database.js" make sure to alter the code in order to connect to your database.

## To download
To download these files click on the green "Code" button and click "download ZIP". Once the files are done downloading, unzip them and begin using.

## To use
To use the files, open GitBash in the main folder of the downloaded files and in GitBash type ```npm start```. The app will then open in the browser on localhost:3000.
